# Pulumi Background #

## Intro & Concepts ##

For some background on Pulumi and the architecture/concepts behind it, read up on it [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/).

## Supported Languages ##

We'll be using YAML as the languaue for these demos, primarily due to it being a fairly common language and does not have any other prerequisites.

If you are interested in what other languages you can use with Pulumi, you can find details [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/).

## Registry ##

We're using the AWS and vSphere providers for the demos during this workshop, but there are lots of other providers in the [Pulumi registry](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/).
